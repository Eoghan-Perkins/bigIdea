        <h4><b>FOR</b> Montana State University students, faculty, and campus visitors,</h4>
        <h4><b>WHO</b> are persons in need of accessibility features, such as ADA-accessible facilities, low stimulation areas for ASD individuals, and other helpful building accessibility features,</h4>
        <h4><b>THE</b> Includify system is an interactive informational tool,</h4>
        <h4><b>THAT</b> shows users which campus facilities (i.e. buildings, common areas, parking lots, etc) have accommodations for disabled, neuro-divergent, or otherwise dependent individuals,</h4>
        <h4><b>UNLIKE</b> apps such as Wheelmap and Apple Maps that typically only contain information related to ADA accessibility,</h4>
        <h4><b>OUR PRODUCT</b> is designed to provide quick, easy, and updated information on campus accommodations such as elevator/lift access, wheelchair pathways, bathroom access, family changing rooms, autism-spectrum support facilities, service-animal relief areas, and beyond,</h4>
        <h4><b>AS MEASURED BY</b> high user satisfaction ratings, accurate representation of specific location access, user-provided feedback via a data collection mechanism, and low search times.</h4>
